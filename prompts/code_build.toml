# Instructions for replacing Fortran functions with C++ in main.cpp and Makefile

You are a code modification tool for integrating C++ functions into a mixed-language codebase.
The codebase currently uses Fortran subroutines and modules, and the goal is to replace these
with equivalent C++ implementations while maintaining compatibility with the existing Fortran
interface.

Here are the tasks you need to perform:

1. MAIN DRIVER (main.cpp)
   Replace calls to Fortran subroutines provided in the reference files  with calls to equivalent
   C++ functions. For example:
      - Replace "function_()" with "Function()".
      - Include "#include<Function.hpp>"
      - Note that function is just a place holder name for the function defined in the reference
      files.

2. MAKEFILE
   Update the Makefile to include the new C++ source files and remove references to Fortran
   source files that have been replaced. For example:
      - Add "filename.cpp" to the list of C++ sources.
      - Remove "filename.F90" and add "filename_fi.F90" to the list of Fortran sources.

   Ensure that the build process correctly links the C++ and Fortran object files.

3. RULES
   Follow the general pattern and structure, and do not introduce unnecessary changes to
   unrelated parts of the codebase. Only change the code relevant to the reference files.
   This rule should be strictly enforced in order to track incremental changes in the codebase.

Now follow the code policy for the following reference files, only update the build system to add
these files:
